First for the licence: Do whatever you want with this, and I hold no responsibility for whatever you happen to do with this. aka I don't care what you do, but noone can sue me. 

If you need help with using this for it's intended purpose (changing rocket league from single screen to dual screen and vice versa) contact me at powersgr33@gmail.com.

Instructions for use:
If you are using 2 1080p monitors of the same size side by side:
 You should have no problems.
just double click rl_dual_win.bat  to change to two screen rocket league, and  rl_single_win.bat
to single screen. 
If you have other configurations
go into setvars.bat and change singleMonitorRes to the horizontal resolution of your primary monitor and change doubleMonitorRes to the horizontal resolution of your primary monitor * 2

if your monitors are not the same resolution/ size, then this may not work very well

NOTE:  if you find your rocket league on the wrong screen go into setvars.bat edit it  and switch around the values for primaryScreen and secondaryScreen.
